# Tutorials-for-Hackers

## Introduction

I have collected a useful set of tutorials and guides to help new hackers get started. I came to the field with no background in IT just an interest and curiosity. I hope these will help you learn the fundamentals too. 

I started out learning the basic methodology and tools with tryhackme. They have great rooms and learning paths for beginners teaching you the fundamentals of networks, the web, linux, bash etc.

Once I was familiar with those fundamentals I realised that I needed to be more familiar in a few languages. At this stage I felt that bash, SQL, Python, JavaScript were the most important for SQLi, XSS, automation and understanding some of the tools and exploits I was using.
